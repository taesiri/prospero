Instead, each console stuck with a default performance target. For the PS5 and Xbox Series X, that meant 60 frames per second, while the Xbox Series S stuck to a more modest 30 frames per second.

There are too many to go over all of them, but a couple stand out for addressing some of the more unusual and humorous glitches that slipped through the Q&amp;A process. Once you install the update, you won\u2019t have to worry about dogs levitating when your character pets them, and crows will no longer randomly fall from the sky when you visit Asgard. Oh, and fish in Norway will now spawn in bad weather. Good stuff.\u00a0</p><p>The update will start rolling out at approximately 7 AM ET.

On Xbox Series X/S, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> will take advantage of Microsoft\u2019s Quick Resume functionality, allowing you to switch between the game and other supported titles nearly instantaneously.

For example, the trigger will be easier to pull when you\u2019re using a lighter weapon like a pistol.

But their core discipline is mechanical engineering.\"\u00a0</p><p>Thanks to their proximity, Team Asobi was able to snag early DualSense prototypes, which at the time were large and saddled with assorted wires. \u201cAt the time, the form factor isn't really the point,\u201d Doucet said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about having all of these features and whether they\u2019re usable inside the game and making the experience better.\u201d\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Doucet and team started rapidly prototyping gameplay concepts. The first was a small shooting range with pistols, shotguns and a variety of other weapons, which was meant to test how the adaptive triggers handled them. They also learned how the revamped haptics could make walking over a variety of surfaces feel distinct even on a handheld device, so you could tell the difference between sand, water and ice without looking at the screen.\u00a0</p><p>One demo effectively simulated the feeling of controlling a character in a motorcycle, so much so that you could feel the engine revving up and the exhaust kicking back in the controller. That test even surprised Sony\u2019s engineers. After Team Asobi shared some of their gameplay findings, the engineers ended up tweaking some aspects of the DualSense controller's design.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt made them think about weight position in the controller, and does it work so you feel it well,\u201d Doucet said.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDo you get that kind of trinity, of what you see, what you feel, and what you feel? Does it feel right? It helps us kind of get better.\u201d\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Team Asobi only had three developers working on the DualSense gameplay prototypes for a few months, but they managed to come up with 80 tech demos. To put this timeframe in perspective, the group was also in the process of finishing their last game, <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission</em>. As they started to think about what to do with their DualSense findings, Asobi decided not just to create a collection of minigames, something that\u2019s been done plenty of times with new tech. (Take, for example, Valve\u2019s \"The Lab\u201d demos that debuted with SteamVR headset.)\u00a0</p><p>Doucet says Team Asobi wanted to do a preinstalled title for the PS5 from the beginning; it wasn\u2019t a mandate from Sony\u2019s higher ups. And they realized they already had a great character in Astro. He's cute, easy to control and likely the best mascot Sony has had yet. (Sorry, Crash Bandicoot.) So Team Asobi decided to do something it\u2019s never done before: build a complete non-VR game for Sony\u2019s new console.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt felt like, if we could absorb as many of these tech demos as possible, and make them inside a cohesive experience, it would probably have a lot more value and fun than having a collection of minigames,\u201d Doucet said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the benefit of bringing our character to a wider audience.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But Team Asobi wasn't the only developer previewing the DualSense hardware. As Doucet describes, the company also brought in PlayStation studios and third-party developers to try out the controller and throw ideas around. His team ended up getting some pointers from Naughty Dog's Santa Monica and others, which made their way into <em>Astro\u2019s Playroom</em>. Team Asobi was able to share their early gameplay demos as well, which could end up influencing the first wave of PlayStation 5 titles.\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>While you wouldn\u2019t know it from playing Astro\u2019s Playroom, it\u2019s Team Asobi\u2019s first non-VR title. And while Sony hasn\u2019t said anything about a new PlayStation VR for the PS5, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Doucet had some ideas in mind for using the DualSense controller in virtual reality.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would love if, two or three years from now, when we look back, we can say for sure that first implementation was really cool, really magical, but today we can do even better,\u201d Doucet said. \u201cI think that would also prove that this technology has got legs to evolve throughout the life cycle [of the PS5]. It's not one of those things that you do once and that\u2019s it. I think we\u2019re going to continue exploring and finding new things, and refining it in ways that maybe today we just haven\u2019t thought of yet.\u201d</p>\n</div>"]}, {"title": "Amazon UK is investigating reports of stolen PS5 orders", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-uk-stolen-sony-ps5-190455178.html", "description": "Some people have had their PS5 orders replaced with cat food and other products.", "date_posted": "11.25.2020", "body": ["<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Between supply shortages and a staggered release date, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html\">PlayStation 5</a> has been almost impossible to buy.

Indeed, a teardown previously <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-official-teardown-124857385.html\">revealed</a> a complex cooling system and a massive heatsink.

As for the console\u2019s design, Morisawa said that he was inspired by the idea of \u201cfive dimensions\u201d and that he wanted a look that conveys the aura of a powerful machine. That said, the console\u2019s design may not be for everyone. When we tested the PS5 for our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html#/\">review</a>, we found that it felt \u201cflimsy and precarious,\u201d like a premium device sandwiched in \u201cbetween two thin pieces of plastic\u201d that couldn\u2019t \u201csurvive even a short drop.\u201d We still gave the console a score of 87, however, for fast 4K gaming, minimal load times and a solid launch lineup.</p>\n</div>"]}, {"title": "'Spider-Man' PS4 update will let you transfer your save to the PS5 remaster", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/marvels-spider-man-ps4-ps5-save-transfers-230329001.html", "description": "An update around Thanksgiving will connect the 'Spider-Man' games across generations.", "date_posted": "11.25.2020", "body": ["<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>In a reversal of an earlier decision,<em> </em>Insomniac Games announced on Monday that PlayStation 4 players will have the ability to transfer their save files from <em>Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man</em> to the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peter-parker-recast-spider-man-remastered-215023780.html\">PlayStation 5 remaster</a> of the game.

OK, that\u2019s a bit much, but the point is, this game is <em>smooth</em>. There's a 30 fps Fidelity mode (where the screenshots came from) and 60 fps Performance mode, which I prefer for the extra clarity it lends Miles\u2019 movements. The game\u2019s main mechanic involves web-slinging across a realistic Manhattan, flying between buildings in a thrilling demonstration of controlled chaos.\u00a0</p><p>Hold down the right trigger and Miles shoots web ropes from his wrist, flinging him through the air automatically and as needed. You\u2019re in control of the direction he soars and when he lets go, determining how high, fast and far he travels with twitch decisions and micro movements. Miles picks up speed quickly and he adapts to environmental changes with ease, swinging from the edge of a building and then running up the side of a skyscraper, leaping from the roof and diving toward a bright yellow waypoint in a series of natural, stylish motions. There\u2019s no wrong way to scale Harlem as Spider-Man.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>In combat, Miles regularly takes on dozens of henchmen at a time, fluidly swapping among enemies and dodging attacks with <em>Arkham</em>-inspired choreography (or, probably more accurately, \u201c<em>Spider-Man</em>-inspired,\u201d but we all know my history there). It\u2019s never difficult to find a target, and battles feel fantastically frenetic, even when it seems like Miles should be overwhelmed. He collects powers beyond Peter Parker\u2019s \u2014 electricity and invisibility \u2014 and these tools are employed in stealth missions and high-action moments in equal measure.\u00a0</p><p>Part of the reason the game feels so seamless is its complete lack of loading screens on the PS5. Between missions, cutscenes and respawns, <em>Miles Morales</em> is an uninterrupted reel, just as Sony has been promising since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/6d6f636869/status/1130645990627631105\" target=\"_blank\">day negative-one</a> of this console generation. If Miles dies in a fight with some suped-up baddies, the scene immediately resets from the last checkpoint and the action continues. Cutscenes bleed seamlessly into gameplay moments and back. There\u2019s no downtime on PS5, unless you decide to take some.</p><p>Even the cutscenes themselves make it difficult to put the controller down. Not only are they beautifully animated, but they\u2019re often sprinkled with quick-time events. They also generate a constant stream of physical feedback in the DualSense, offering a taste of how delicate and precise the haptics in the new controller can be.</p><figure><img alt=\"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales captured on PS5.\" credit=\"Engadget\" crediturl=\"\" data-ops=\"\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-11%2F9aeb6ee0-1fbe-11eb-af9d-40ff60d4fff8&amp;thumbnail=640%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=acbe7163a39263b855e7eeb07c5ee337a74708d3\"> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </img></figure><p><em>Miles Morales</em> is packed with classic superhero action and drama.

And when they\u2019re deployed well, as they are in <em>Miles Morales</em>, they\u2019re incredibly fun.</p><p>Though Insomniac is billing <em>Miles Morales</em> as a standalone expansion, smaller in scope than the PS4 original, the game is dense with side quests, collectibles, training modules and places to explore. The Harlem on the screen is rich with life, and the characters around Miles are relatable and warm.

Its lack of load times, sharp graphics and buttery mechanics showcase the power of the new console and the DualSense controller brilliantly. This is one of Sony\u2019s strongest selling points in the new generation: The PS5 ships with new, marquee games like <em>Miles Morales</em>, the <em>Demon\u2019s Souls</em> remaster and <em>Bugsnax</em> (yes, <em>Bugsnax</em>).

The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-14-sony-playstation-4-review.html\">PS4</a> handily outsold every other previous-generation console. But instead of coasting on its success, the company is staying aggressive with the <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/campaigns/2020/ps5-direct-pre-orders/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation 5</a>. It generally matches the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html\">Xbox Series X\u2019s</a> fast hardware, and it also has one of the most innovative controllers we've ever seen. While the PS5's design may be a matter of taste, at least Sony succeeded in delivering something Microsoft couldn't: must-have games that actually take advantage of its hardware.</p><p>So much of the PlayStation 5 screams \"next generation\" -- and that's a good thing when many gamers are eager for a reason to upgrade. Because let's face it, the last round of systems were kind of a mess. The PS4 and Xbox One aged so poorly as consumers adopted 4K TVs, that the old hardware practically demanded mid-cycle refreshes: the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. And while those systems were certainly powerful, bringing us close to the dream of 4K gaming in our living rooms, they were bogged down by slow mechanical hard drives and hardware that was easily outmatched by basic gaming PCs. They were a stop-gap measure, and nothing more.</p>\n</div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1 Array\">\n<p>The $500 PS5 we\u2019re reviewing, and the Xbox Series X, are a step into a glorious new world of console gaming. And if you don\u2019t need a disc drive, you can also grab the PS5 Digital Edition for $400.</p>\n</div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n</div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>I get it: Sony wanted to optimize airflow as much as possible to keep the PS5's CPU and GPU cool, so the plastic fins serve a genuine purpose. That's why Microsoft basically made its system a mini-PC tower. But Sony surely could have come up with a design that wasn't so unwieldy.</p><p>While I have many concerns about the way the system looks and feels, under the hood the PS5 is poised to deliver a solid 4K gaming experience. It's powered by a custom eight-core Zen 2 processor and a 10.2-teraflop RDNA 2 GPU. On paper, its GPU would seem to lag behind the 12-teraflop Xbox Series X, but remember that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3090-3080-3070-cuda-core-int32-fp32-210059544.html\">teraflops can be a notoriously sloppy way</a> to determine how fast a system can actually perform.</p><p>Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X feature 16GB of GDDR6 RAM, which each system handles a bit differently when it comes to overall memory bandwidth. The next-gen consoles also rely on NVMe SSDs for storage, an upgrade that'll make your games load much faster than older mechanical hard drives. One big plus in Sony\u2019s column: It allows you to plug in a third-party SSD by removing a side panel, giving you far cheaper storage upgrade options than Seagate's $220 1TB SSD expansion card. But just note that you can\u2019t add a new SSD at launch, and the drives that meet Sony\u2019s spec won\u2019t be cheap, so don't go filling up your drives right away.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Sony's new DualSense controller is your gateway to the PS5, and for once it doesn't look exactly like the original PlayStation's controller. Sony stuck with that tried-and-true design for decades, but this time it went with something different. The DualSense is larger than the DualShock 4, with thicker grips that make it much more comfortable to hold. Its basic layout is the same, except now the buttons look like transparent jewels and there's a button for muting the built-in microphone. It\u2019s mostly white design is sure to look messier than the PS4's controllers over time, but after a week of testing it still looks relatively clean.</p><p>What's most impressive about the DualSense is what's inside -- chiefly, some of the most advanced haptic controls I've ever felt. Its analog triggers can be manipulated on the fly, to recreate the sensation of pulling an arrow back in a bow, or running out of ammo in your gun. And you can forget about the basic vibration from the DualShock 4, the DualSense almost feels like it's alive in your hands. I nearly jumped out of my seat the first time I loaded up <em>Astro's Playroom</em>. The DualSense's vibration is so finely tuned that you can feel a distinct difference when Astro is walking over sand, wood and metal surfaces. It feels truly next generation in a way the Xbox Series X's controller doesn't.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<h2>Setup: A stand, really?</h2><p>Before you can even plug in the PS5, you'll have to learn how to install its plastic stand. While the console can stand vertically on its own, Sony recommends using it for both orientations. And once you handle the console, it's easy to see why. The PS5 is just too precarious when it's standing up without a stand; all it takes is a light brush from a child or pet to send your $500 console crashing to the floor. And if it's sitting horizontally, the system wobbles like an enormous egg, which also makes me worried it'll eventually roll off my table. So the stand makes sense -- but I don't have to like it.</p><p>It screws onto the bottom of the console if you're standing it up, or slides into the back if it's going horizontal. Sony includes an instruction sheet that's relatively clear, but I'll be honest: That's the last thing I want to look at when I just want to play some games. In horizontal mode, I also found that the stand slipped out easily if I needed to adjust the console, or pull it forward a bit to plug in some cables. There's nothing securing it to the system; it just bites into the rear of the console, making it appear as if it's floating in the air.</p><figure class=\"iframe-container\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"720\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaAY-jAjm0w\" width=\"1280\"></iframe></figure><p>I won't harp on this too much, but I'm sure Sony could have come up with a design that didn't feel so overcooked. The PS4 and PS4 Pro were just angular slabs of plastic. But they felt solid, and it didn't take an IKEA instruction sheet to figure out how to put them in my entertainment center. I'll be honest, I had a hard time figuring out the right way to lay the PS5 on its side, since there's no visual indicator of where the top and bottom is. I was baffled that Sony's engineers could overlook such a simple usability flaw.</p><p>Once you figure out the puzzle of the PS5's stand, you just need to flip it on, go through the setup process and start downloading any required updates. And unlike the Xbox Series X, you can actually play something without waiting for a download and installation. <em>Astro's Playroom</em> ships with every system, and it's a smart way to get you used to the DualSense's capabilities. I was also pleased to see that downloading games from Sony's store was far faster than with the PS4. Over my wireless connection, it sucked down a 40GB game in around 50 minutes.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<h2>In use: Impressive next-gen gaming</h2><p><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> isn't a next-generation exclusive, but it still does a stellar job of showing what the PS5 is capable of. By default, it runs in 4K at 30 fps with ray tracing and tons of graphical flourishes. Everything looks spectacular, especially the realistic reflections in water and glass. But, this being a <em>Spidey</em> game, I preferred the fluidity of performance mode at 60 fps, which drops ray tracing in favor of smoother overall visuals. It made zipping through the city feel far more thrilling, though I definitely missed the added realism of ray tracing in cutscenes.</p><p>Thanks to the PS5\u2019s SSD, load times are minimal in <em>Miles Morales</em>. It takes around 15 seconds to get from the title screen to gameplay. And while playing, I rarely encountered load times, even when jumping out of complex buildings into the game\u2019s loving recreation of NYC. One cute thing I appreciated: you can actually hear <em>Miles</em> web shooters from the DualSense controller.</p><p>While the performance mode doesn't run at 4K, it still looks relatively sharp. I would have loved the option of a 1080p/60 fps mode that included ray tracing, though. I'd happily sacrifice a few pixels to get a fast frame rate <em>and </em>ray traced realism. Generally, that's the stand I take with every game.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p><em>Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition</em>, for instance, also has a ray-tracing infused 4K mode. But while it looks good, that felt a bit too slow for the fast-paced hack-and-slash nature of that game, so I opted for the 1080p/60 fps mode instead. And if you've got a newer 120Hz TV, you can also run the game at that refresh rate for even smoother performance, without ray tracing and other graphical upgrades.</p><p>The PS5's interface features a new control center, which pops up when you hit the PlayStation button. It makes it easy to keep track of the games you're playing and recent captures. But the most significant addition are \"Activities\" cards, which can show you tips for the level you're in. You can even look up the current mission you're on, refresh yourself on your objectives, and get an estimate on how long it'll take to finish. I won't have much use for the hints, but it's nice to have a basic sense of how long a level will take, especially when my gaming time is so limited these days.</p><p>In lieu of other new games, like the <em>Demon's Souls</em> remake, I also spent a bit of time revisiting PS4 titles like <em>Ghosts of Tsushima.</em> It's been updated to take advantage of the PS5's hardware, so now I can finally get my samurai action on at 60 fps. It also loads far faster than on the PS4 Pro, as you\u2019d expect. Other games that haven't been patched yet, like <em>The Last of Us 2</em> and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, also have dramatically faster load times. I'm hoping developers spend a bit of time improving those older titles, because the framerate bump can have a dramatic impact.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>It's a shame the PS5 is launching with only a handful of truly next-gen titles, but\u00a0honestly that's better than the Xbox Series X, which doesn't have much beyond new third-party games (that Sony is also getting). <em>Halo Infinite</em> is delayed until next year, so Xbox fans will have to make do with their (admittedly large) collection of Game Pass and backward-compatible titles. While the PS5 can play most PS4 games, it doesn't have any support for PS3 or PS2 games (except through PSNow), so be sure to keep your old consoles around.</p><p>At the very least, Sony didn\u2019t abandon its successful PlayStation VR headset. You\u2019ll still be able to play PS4 VR games on the PS5, but you\u2019ll need to request a free adapter from Sony to connect your old camera. Weirdly, the PSVR doesn\u2019t support the new HD PS5 camera. We also haven\u2019t heard any details about a next-generation VR follow-up from Sony, but I imagine it wouldn\u2019t rely on a camera or sensor.</p><p>The PS5 can also be used as a 4K Blu-ray player, a feature that's been a long time coming, especially since that's a format Sony has backed as part of the Blu-ray Consortium. Unfortunately, we can't talk much about the system's entertainment capabilities just yet, as it's still a work in progress at the time of review. But it's not as if running Netflix or Hulu is a particularly difficult task for such a powerful system.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<h2>The competition</h2><p>Unlike Microsoft's consoles, both PS5 models have the same hardware. The only difference is that the $400 \"Digital Edition\" doesn't have a disc drive of any kind. These days, I tend to download all of my games, but I still like having a disc drive around for playing used titles or my handful of PS4 discs. But if you're not so nostalgic about physical media,\u00a0 it makes sense to get the Digital Edition and save that extra $100 for an extra SSD down the line.</p><p>Compared to the Xbox Series X, the PS5 stands out with a far stronger launch lineup and a more innovative controller. But Sony has always been better at nabbing enticing exclusives. And, of course, it has the rights to popular characters like <em>Spider-Man</em>. But if you're more interested in a wide variety of games, as opposed to big budget exclusives, Microsoft may have the leg-up with its GamePass subscription service. That gives you access to a rotating library of titles, all of Microsoft\u2019s first-party games, as well as games from EA Play and eventually Bethesda, all for a single monthly fee. That's something Sony is trying to imitate with its<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-free-games-210040338.html\"> PS Plus Collection free games</a>, which now gives you access to popular PlayStation titles for free. But while those games are great, they include plenty of titles like <em>God of War</em> and <em>Uncharted 4</em> that many PlayStation fans likely own already.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>With the PS5, Sony has managed to deliver a truly next-generation console, even if it went a bit overboard on the design. Its controller is genuinely innovative, and it actually has a bunch of new games you\u2019ll want to play. But I won\u2019t say that Sony has won the next-gen war just yet -- maybe just the launch battle. Microsoft remains a strong competitor, especially with Game Pass, xCloud streaming and Bethesda under its wing. But in the end, it doesn\u2019t even matter if there\u2019s actually a decisive winner -- just be happy you\u2019ve got two solid consoles to choose from that can take on gaming PCs.</p>\n</div>"]}, {"title": "The PS5 will only be sold online on launch day", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ps5-launch-day-sales-online-only-sony-144429615.html", "description": "Sony said it\u2019s a safety measure amid the COVID-19 pandemic.", "date_posted": "11.25.2020", "body": ["<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>If you haven\u2019t been able to lock in a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ps5-dualsense-hands-on-hardware-first-look-120027948.html\">PlayStation 5</a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-5-console-accessories-pre-order-guide-181500425.html\">pre-order</a>, don\u2019t plan to line up at a local retailer in the hopes of snagging the console on launch day.

Some of that success can be attributed to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-review-sucker-punch-productions-140018797.html\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, which sold 2.4 million <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1286632240949219331\" target=\"_blank\">in its first three days</a>. PlayStation Plus, meanwhile, has steadily grown to 45.9 million subscribers, up almost a million from the previous quarter. Unfortunately, Sony didn\u2019t share any PlayStation Now numbers today.</p><p>The rest of Sony\u2019s business is a little rocky. The music side pulled in revenue of 230.8 billion yen (roughly $2.2 billion), which was higher than the same quarter last year. Sony\u2019s movie division continues to struggle, though. The company only released two films in the US last quarter \u2014 <em>The Broken Hearts Gallery</em> and <em>The Last Shift</em> \u2014 neither of which made a lot of money. For comparison, Sony put <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>, <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> and <em>The Angry Birds Movie 2</em> in theaters during the same quarter last year. The smartphone team, meanwhile, sold just 600,000 handsets during the three-month period, which is identical to the numbers it posted last year.

Standing at 15.4 inches tall and 10.2 inches deep, the PS5 looks less like a gaming console and more like a massive, old-school encyclopedia, but bound in bright white fondant and completed with a black display plate. To use a more relevant simile, the PS5 looks like a PC tower.\u00a0</p><p>No matter whether you store it vertically or horizontally, this beast will stand out in a living room.</p>\n</div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1 no-review\">\n<p>The PS5\u2019s size may not be its most exciting feature, considering it has a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-18-playstation-5-teraflop-specs.html\">10.28-teraflop GPU and a custom 825GB SSD</a>, but that\u2019s basically all we\u2019re allowed to talk about right now. Similar to Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-first-look-video-preview-130102895.html\">Xbox Series X</a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-final-preview-a-deeper-dive-130018246.html\">previews</a>, Sony has laid out coverage restrictions before the launch of the PS5 and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-211944080.html\">the Digital Edition </a>on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ps5-price-release-date-204606914.html\">November 12th</a>. So, today we\u2019re only going to discuss how the console looks with the power off, and how the new <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mrcNKp\" target=\"_blank\">DualSense controller</a> performs in one segment of one demo game.</p><p>First up, let\u2019s look at how this monster will fit in most media centers.</p><h2>The bulk of the beast</h2><figure><img alt=\"PlayStation 5 first look, DualSense hands-on\" credit=\"Engadget\" crediturl=\"\" data-ops=\"\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-10%2Fdbfb1131-17f6-11eb-bfd7-43b475cd62d7&amp;thumbnail=640%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=64a916faea822a13111eb5f7c5fa49c28b248949\"> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </img></figure><p>Not only is the PS5 physically imposing, but it\u2019s heavy, too. With the display plate attached, the console weighs 10.2 pounds, according to my bathroom scale. The Series X, meanwhile, weighs 9.2 pounds on the same scale, which isn\u2019t a huge difference. However, this is where the industrial design of each console really comes into play: The Series X is a solid box, 11.8 inches tall and about 6 inches wide on all sides, and its weight feels evenly distributed within that package. I\u2019ve never worried about dropping the Series X while moving it between rooms.\u00a0</p><p>The PS5, on the other hand, is difficult to handle. Its length naturally makes its weight unwieldy, and it feels like a bad idea to grab the console by those white fins, so picking it up always seems like a gamble. Luckily, the PS5 isn\u2019t a mobile device. Once you figure out where the console will live in your house, you probably won\u2019t have to move it around, making the weight a relative non-issue.</p><p>One thing that will definitely be an issue, or at least a consideration, is that display stand. The PS5 comes with a black plastic plate designed to hold the base of the console when it\u2019s standing upright or to prop it up when it\u2019s resting horizontally, disc drive down. It essentially makes the PS5 float. Considering the heft of the console, this extra support is welcome, and the display plate definitely makes everything feel more secure.</p><figure><img alt=\"PlayStation 5 first look, DualSense hands-on\" credit=\"Engadget\" crediturl=\"\" data-ops=\"\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-10%2Fdbf740a0-17f6-11eb-bff3-ca66e7f6b92a&amp;thumbnail=640%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=f8f80f4aa0e182d7e56bbad82aabfbfce555c121\"> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </img></figure><p>It\u2019s also the most annoying aspect of the PS5 set-up process. When I saw the plate tucked into the box, my excitement for the new console dimmed, realizing I\u2019d have to figure out some sort of accessory puzzle before actually booting everything up.\u00a0</p><p>To attach the stand to the vertical base of the console, twist open the bottom of the plate to reveal a hidden screw. On the base of the PS5, remove the circular tab covering the screw hole, and pop it into the open slot on the bottom of the disc, next to the screw. Remove the screw, line up the holes on the plate and the console, and twist it all together using a coin, fingernail or tool. I found it easier to dangle the \u201cbutt\u201d end of the console over the edge of my couch, so I could attach the plate with easier access.</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>To store the PS5 horizontally, there are no screws required. With the bottom twisted closed, the plate simply clips onto the back edge of the console and holds tight.</p><p>With the support stand, Sony has given every PS5 player an Ikea-inspired chore, and it interrupts the new-console flow -- but that doesn\u2019t mean the PS5 is a bust.\u00a0</p><h2>Trigger warning</h2><figure><img alt=\"PlayStation 5 first look, DualSense hands-on\" credit=\"Engadget\" crediturl=\"\" data-ops=\"\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-10%2Fdbfb1132-17f6-11eb-bd3b-05a41bcdc950&amp;thumbnail=640%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=5b748df00bfde0cb28d88e51e2deec227ac87240\"> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </img></figure><p>The new <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mrcNKp\" target=\"_blank\">DualSense controller</a> is a legitimate improvement over the existing DualShock series, with a solid body, slightly wider grip, microphone button and truly enjoyable trigger actions. It\u2019s sturdier than a DualShock, and the clear face buttons look and feel high-quality. Plus, if you get really, really close to the back of the grips, you\u2019ll see the texture there is composed of incredibly small squares, circles, triangles and Xs, the classic PlayStation symbols. It\u2019s a cute touch.\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>The R1 and L1 bumpers are wide and clicky, while the main R2 and L2 triggers have a substantial, smooth range of motion, and their tension can change on the fly, opening up an array of new gameplay possibilities. The gamepad has a microphone, a large touchpad and motion-sensing technology as well. Overall, the DualSense feels great both in the hand and in-game.</p><p>I played through the Cooling Springs level in <em>Astro\u2019s Playroom</em>, a demo title showing off all the new tricks of the DualSense. As my little astronaut character wobbled around a busy beach, the controller barely stopped moving, vibrating and bouncing in response to most actions on the screen. There\u2019s some serious haptic hardware in the DualSense, and if I listened closely, I could hear its gears churning over the cute sounds creeping out of the controller\u2019s small speaker.\u00a0</p><figure><img alt=\"PlayStation 5 first look, DualSense hands-on\" credit=\"Engadget\" crediturl=\"\" data-ops=\"\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-10%2Fdbf740a1-17f6-11eb-b37c-cde250d448e9&amp;thumbnail=640%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=431e95b695be5e023f79fdd47d654885748c1253\"> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </img></figure><p>Hands-down, the adjustable trigger tension is the coolest aspect of the DualSense. By default, the R2 and L2 triggers are as easy to press as any other button, but developers can alter how much pressure it takes to pull each one down, increasing immersion and introducing new input methods to a gamepad staple.\u00a0</p><p>In the Cooling Springs demo, my character jumped into a robot suit that moved by springing into the air in the direction of the controller\u2019s tilt. During this section, the tension on the R2 and L2 triggers increased significantly, making me press extra hard to land the jumps. It was a pleasant, joyful surprise, and adjustable trigger tension remains one of my most-anticipated features of the PS5.</p><h2>More to come</h2><figure><img alt=\"PlayStation 5 first look, DualSense hands-on\" credit=\"Engadget\" crediturl=\"\" data-ops=\"\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-10%2Fdbf740a2-17f6-11eb-beed-16f33b4313b1&amp;thumbnail=640%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=7fa2cc242a0fc9701900d39d2229a5c278b9601f\"> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </img></figure><p>The PS5 looks like a collaboration between HR Giger and your local mom-and-pop bakery, with shiny black gills cocooned in supple-looking fins; hard and soft at the same time.
