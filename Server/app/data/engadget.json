Instead, each console stuck with a default performance target. For the PS5 and Xbox Series X, that meant 60 frames per second, while the Xbox Series S stuck to a more modest 30 frames per second. Ubisoft says the update also tweaks the Series X and Series S versions of the game to improve overall performance, including the screen tearing that\u2019s been an issue on those consoles.\u00a0</p><p>If you\u2019ve had a chance to play <em>Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla</em>, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a buggy game in its current state.

There are too many to go over all of them, but a couple stand out for addressing some of the more unusual and humorous glitches that slipped through the Q&amp;A process. Once you install the update, you won\u2019t have to worry about dogs levitating when your character pets them, and crows will no longer randomly fall from the sky when you visit Asgard. Oh, and fish in Norway will now spawn in bad weather. Good stuff.\u00a0</p><p>The update will start rolling out at approximately 7 AM ET.

On Xbox Series X/S, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> will take advantage of Microsoft\u2019s Quick Resume functionality, allowing you to switch between the game and other supported titles nearly instantaneously.

For example, the trigger will be easier to pull when you\u2019re using a lighter weapon like a pistol.

So if you own the game on PS4, you won\u2019t have to buy it again on PS5. What\u2019s more, your progression and in-game items will carry over.

But their core discipline is mechanical engineering.\"\u00a0</p><p>Thanks to their proximity, Team Asobi was able to snag early DualSense prototypes, which at the time were large and saddled with assorted wires. \u201cAt the time, the form factor isn't really the point,\u201d Doucet said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about having all of these features and whether they\u2019re usable inside the game and making the experience better.\u201d\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Doucet and team started rapidly prototyping gameplay concepts. The first was a small shooting range with pistols, shotguns and a variety of other weapons, which was meant to test how the adaptive triggers handled them. They also learned how the revamped haptics could make walking over a variety of surfaces feel distinct even on a handheld device, so you could tell the difference between sand, water and ice without looking at the screen.\u00a0</p><p>One demo effectively simulated the feeling of controlling a character in a motorcycle, so much so that you could feel the engine revving up and the exhaust kicking back in the controller. That test even surprised Sony\u2019s engineers. After Team Asobi shared some of their gameplay findings, the engineers ended up tweaking some aspects of the DualSense controller's design.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt made them think about weight position in the controller, and does it work so you feel it well,\u201d Doucet said.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDo you get that kind of trinity, of what you see, what you feel, and what you feel? Does it feel right? It helps us kind of get better.\u201d\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Team Asobi only had three developers working on the DualSense gameplay prototypes for a few months, but they managed to come up with 80 tech demos. To put this timeframe in perspective, the group was also in the process of finishing their last game, <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission</em>. As they started to think about what to do with their DualSense findings, Asobi decided not just to create a collection of minigames, something that\u2019s been done plenty of times with new tech. (Take, for example, Valve\u2019s \"The Lab\u201d demos that debuted with SteamVR headset.)\u00a0</p><p>Doucet says Team Asobi wanted to do a preinstalled title for the PS5 from the beginning; it wasn\u2019t a mandate from Sony\u2019s higher ups. And they realized they already had a great character in Astro. He's cute, easy to control and likely the best mascot Sony has had yet. (Sorry, Crash Bandicoot.) So Team Asobi decided to do something it\u2019s never done before: build a complete non-VR game for Sony\u2019s new console.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt felt like, if we could absorb as many of these tech demos as possible, and make them inside a cohesive experience, it would probably have a lot more value and fun than having a collection of minigames,\u201d Doucet said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the benefit of bringing our character to a wider audience.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But Team Asobi wasn't the only developer previewing the DualSense hardware. As Doucet describes, the company also brought in PlayStation studios and third-party developers to try out the controller and throw ideas around. His team ended up getting some pointers from Naughty Dog's Santa Monica and others, which made their way into <em>Astro\u2019s Playroom</em>. Team Asobi was able to share their early gameplay demos as well, which could end up influencing the first wave of PlayStation 5 titles.\u00a0</p> </div>", "<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>While you wouldn\u2019t know it from playing Astro\u2019s Playroom, it\u2019s Team Asobi\u2019s first non-VR title. And while Sony hasn\u2019t said anything about a new PlayStation VR for the PS5, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Doucet had some ideas in mind for using the DualSense controller in virtual reality.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would love if, two or three years from now, when we look back, we can say for sure that first implementation was really cool, really magical, but today we can do even better,\u201d Doucet said. \u201cI think that would also prove that this technology has got legs to evolve throughout the life cycle [of the PS5]. It's not one of those things that you do once and that\u2019s it. I think we\u2019re going to continue exploring and finding new things, and refining it in ways that maybe today we just haven\u2019t thought of yet.\u201d</p>\n</div>"]}, {"title": "Amazon UK is investigating reports of stolen PS5 orders", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-uk-stolen-sony-ps5-190455178.html", "description": "Some people have had their PS5 orders replaced with cat food and other products.", "date_posted": "11.25.2020", "body": ["<div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\">\n<p>Between supply shortages and a staggered release date, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html\">PlayStation 5</a> has been almost impossible to buy.
